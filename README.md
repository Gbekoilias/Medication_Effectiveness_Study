# Medication Effectiveness Study Repository

## Overview
This repository contains data and analysis for a study assessing the effectiveness of a new medication in treating a specific disease. The study involved 200 participants, half receiving the medication and half receiving a placebo. The observed improvement rates after six months raise questions about whether the difference is due to chance or the medication's effectiveness.

## Files
1. **study_data.csv**: Dataset containing information on the improvement outcomes for participants who received the medication and the placebo.

2. **analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook providing detailed analysis, statistical calculations, and probability assessment.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medication-effectiveness-study.git
Open and run the analysis.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.

Analysis Process
Data Exploration: Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
Statistical Analysis: Perform hypothesis testing and calculate relevant statistics.
Probability Calculation: Assess the probability that the observed difference in improvement rates is due to chance alone.
Mathematics and Statistics
Hypothesis Testing: Utilize statistical methods to compare medication and placebo groups.
Probability Calculation: Use percentage data to simulate a dataset and determine the likelihood of observed outcomes under chance.
Conclusion
Explore the provided analysis to gain insights into the medication's effectiveness, statistical significance, and the probability of the observed results occurring randomly.

Note:
Adjust parameters, conduct additional analyses, or customize the code as needed for specific inquiries or extensions to the study.
